> My solution to a coding challenge from Tatcha.  Lets end-users enter in the userId of users found at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, then displays that user's albums' titles.  Each title can be clicked on to display thumbnails of that album's photos.

Prompt: 

Please having him create a simple application from this API endpoint:  http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

What he does with it is his choice. I'm trying to see his creativity in being able to figure out how to do things on his own without much guidance. 

Quick-start instructions:

After git cloning, run: `npm install`, then: `npm run dev` will start a server listening on process.env.PORT (defaults to port 3000) that will automagically restart on changes to .js files.
